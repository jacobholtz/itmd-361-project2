  <p>I have one dog named Baylee and one cat named Ollie. Ollie is an orange cat, I have no clue what the breed is. Baylee is a bassador, a mix between a labrador and a beagle. Ollie is just under 1 year old and Baylee is 5 and a half. Enjoy the following images.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Ollie likes to stand on random things, such as the banister over the stairs or on the dumbbells as pictured here.</p>

  <p>Anyone who owns a cat knows about the loaf or rotisserie position, where they tuck in their legs and tail.</p>

  <p>Ollie and Baylee in a picture together. Baylee is sometimes mean to Ollie and likes to chase him around but it usally doesn't last more than a few seconds. Most of the time they get along.</p>

  <p>Here is Baylee crunched in the bathroom next to the bathtub. You can almost always find her on a floor vent here or in the foyer since she loves the warm air. But I still can't figure out how she finds this comfortable. Maybe it's because she is so fat, her neck rolls act as a pillow.</p>
